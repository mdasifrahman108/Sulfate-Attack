Internal Sulfate Attack in Concrete

Pyrrhotite oxidation triggers sulfate attack, a key factor in reducing durability in concrete. Here, we propose PyrrhotiteNet, a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) that fuses observed data with reaction-diffusion PDEs to model internal sulfate attack (ISA) dynamics in concrete. Through automatic differentiation and sequential learning, PyrrhotiteNet helps to precisely predict sulfate attack severity and distribution.
